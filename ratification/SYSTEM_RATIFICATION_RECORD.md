The following structural invariants are hereby locked and may not be modified without formal constitutional amendment:

1. System MUST be composed only of Organs

5. System MUST NOT bypass lower-layer invariants
6. System MUST NOT merge unrelated domains without audit
7. System boundaries must remain stable
8. Systems may interoperate but not fuse
9. Systems may host UI but not implement UI primitives
10. Systems cannot embed deployment logic
11. Systems cannot bypass Tissue abstraction

These invariants are constitutionally binding and non-mutable without formal amendment.
