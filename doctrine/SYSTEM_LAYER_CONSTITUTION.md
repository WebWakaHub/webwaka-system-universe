# SYSTEM LAYER CONSTITUTION

---

## I. Layer Definition

This document defines the System Layer as follows:

**System = Structured assembly of Organs forming a coherent Suite / Domain Platform.**

### Clarifications

- System is composed of Organs
- System expresses full domain capability surface
- System may be deployable
- System may expose APIs
- System may host UI (but does not define UI mechanics)

---

## II. Structural Distinction

### Organ vs System

**Organs** represent single business capability domains composed of Tissues. Organs express domain-level business semantics without forming complete deployable solutions.

**Systems** are structured assemblies of Organs that form coherent suites or domain platforms. Systems express full domain capability surfaces and may be deployable units.

---

### System vs Product

**Systems** are structured assemblies of Organs that express complete domain capability surfaces. Systems represent architectural units with stable domain boundaries.

**Products** are market-facing offerings that may bundle one or more Systems with branding, packaging, pricing, and go-to-market strategies. Products are not architectural units.

---

### System vs Deployment

**Systems** define the logical assembly of Organs into coherent capability suites. Systems may be deployable but do not define infrastructure topology.

**Deployments** represent the physical or virtual instantiation of Systems within specific infrastructure environments. Deployments are not architectural units.

---

### System vs Ecosystem

**Systems** are structured assemblies of Organs with defined boundaries and coherent domain surfaces. Systems operate as discrete capability units.

**Ecosystems** represent networks of interoperating Systems, external services, and participants. Ecosystems transcend individual System boundaries and represent multi-System coordination patterns.

---

## III. Structural Invariants

The following structural invariants are mandatory and immutable without constitutional amendment:

1. System MUST be composed only of Organs.
2. System MUST maintain domain coherence.
3. System MUST NOT redefine Organ semantics.
4. System MUST NOT implement infrastructure topology.
5. System MUST NOT bypass lower-layer invariants.
6. System MUST NOT merge unrelated domains without audit.
7. System boundaries must remain stable.
8. Systems may interoperate but not fuse.
9. Systems may host UI but not implement UI primitives.

---

## IV. Boundary Clarifications

Systems explicitly exclude the following:

- No Organelle redefinition
- No Cell composition inside System
- No Tissue orchestration definition
- No infrastructure orchestration
- No plugin registration logic

---

## V. Amendment Rules

The following amendment rules govern modifications to the System Layer:

- System classification changes require audit
- Merging Systems requires structural review
- Splitting Systems requires domain coherence validation

---

## VI. Ratification Statement

This document declares:

- System Layer constitutional foundation established
- Organ Layer sealed beneath it
- Ecosystem modeling stabilized

**Status:** RATIFIED  
**Authority:** Founder
