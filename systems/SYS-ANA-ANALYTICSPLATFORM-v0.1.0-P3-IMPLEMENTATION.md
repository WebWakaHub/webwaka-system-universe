> ## I. PURPOSE & SCOPE
> 
> This document provides the **System Implementation Plan** for the Analytics Platform System, as required by Phase 3 of the industrialization model. It outlines the strategy for implementing the system based on the designs produced in Phase 1.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## II. IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY
> 
> The implementation will be carried out in an agile manner, with a focus on delivering working software in small, incremental batches. The implementation will be organized into a series of sprints, with each sprint delivering a set of features.
> 
> ### A. Development Workflow
> 
> - **Branching Model:** A GitFlow-based branching model will be used to manage the development process.
> - **Code Reviews:** All code will be subject to a mandatory code review process to ensure quality and consistency.
> - **Continuous Integration:** A CI/CD pipeline will be used to automate the build, test, and deployment process.
> 
> ### B. Implementation Phases
> 
> The implementation will be phased, with each phase focusing on a specific set of capabilities:
> 
> - **Phase 1: Core Infrastructure:** Set up the core infrastructure, including the Kubernetes cluster, networking, and CI/CD pipeline.
> - **Phase 2: Data Ingestion & Storage:** Implement the Data & Records Management Organ, including the data ingestion pipeline and data storage.
> - **Phase 3: Analytics & Reporting:** Implement the Intelligence & Optimization Organ, including the analytical model execution and reporting capabilities.
> - **Phase 4: Governance & Compliance:** Implement the Governance & Policy and Trust & Compliance Organs, including policy enforcement, auditing, and compliance monitoring.
