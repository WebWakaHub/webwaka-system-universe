> ## I. PURPOSE & SCOPE
> 
> This document provides the **System Validation Plan** for the Analytics Platform System, as required by Phase 2 of the industrialization model. It outlines the strategy for validating the system design against the requirements defined in the Phase 0 Specification.
> 
> ---
> 
> ## II. VALIDATION STRATEGY
> 
> The validation strategy is based on a comprehensive set of tests that cover all aspects of the system, from individual components to the end-to-end user experience.
> 
> ### A. Testing Levels
> 
> - **Unit Testing:** Each microservice will have a comprehensive suite of unit tests to validate its internal logic.
> - **Integration Testing:** The interactions between microservices will be validated through a series of integration tests.
> - **System Testing:** The end-to-end functionality of the system will be validated through a set of system-level tests.
> - **Performance Testing:** The performance and scalability of the system will be validated under various load conditions.
> - **Security Testing:** The security of the system will be validated through penetration testing and vulnerability scanning.
> 
> ### B. Test Automation
> 
> All tests will be automated and integrated into a continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline. This ensures that the system is continuously validated as new code is developed and deployed.
