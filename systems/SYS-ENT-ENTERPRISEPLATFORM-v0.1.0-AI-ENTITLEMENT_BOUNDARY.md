## Purpose

This document defines the AI entitlement boundaries for the `Enterprise Platform` system (`SYS-ENT-ENTERPRISEPLATFORM-v0.1.0`). It specifies what AI capabilities are permitted, restricted, and prohibited within the system boundary.

## Entitlement Matrix

| Capability | Entitlement | Governance Level |
|------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Text generation | Permitted (advisory) | System |
| Data classification | Permitted (automated) | System |
| Decision automation | Restricted (human-in-loop) | Organism |
| State mutation | Prohibited | Governance Universe |
| Cross-system data access | Restricted (explicit consent) | Organism |
| Model fine-tuning | Restricted (ratification required) | Governance Universe |

## Boundary Enforcement

Entitlement boundaries are enforced at the SYSX-AI gateway layer. Any attempt to exceed defined entitlements triggers an automatic escalation to the Governance Universe for review.

## Constitutional Compliance

This definition is constitutionally sealed under AGENT_EXECUTION_CONTEXT_MASTER_CONSTITUTION_v1.0.0 and the IAAM Constitution v1.0.0.
