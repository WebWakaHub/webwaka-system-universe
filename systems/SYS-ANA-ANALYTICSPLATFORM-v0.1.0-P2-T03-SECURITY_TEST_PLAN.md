> 
> ## II. SECURITY TEST PLAN
> 
> ### A. Scope
> 
> The security test plan covers all components of the Analytics Platform System, including:
> 
> - All microservices and APIs.
> - The underlying infrastructure and network configuration.
> - All data stores and data-in-transit.
> 
> ### B. Approach
> 
> - **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):** Automated code analysis will be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the source code.
> - **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** The running application will be scanned for vulnerabilities using a DAST tool.
> - **Penetration Testing:** A third-party security firm will be engaged to conduct a comprehensive penetration test of the system.
> - **Dependency Scanning:** All third-party dependencies will be continuously scanned for known vulnerabilities.
>

> 
> ## III. CONSTITUTIONAL COMPLIANCE
> 
> This test plan is fully compliant with all governing constitutions and platform doctrines.
