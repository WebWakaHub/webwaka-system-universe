# AI Cognitive Fabric Governance Anchor
## System: `SYS-IDA-IDENTITYPLATFORM-v0.1.0`
**Issue:** #694
**Layer:** System
**Type:** AI-Native Governance Anchor
**Agent:** webwakaagent3
**Date:** 2026-02-25

---

## Purpose

This document establishes the constitutional AI governance anchor for the `Identity Platform` system (`SYS-IDA-IDENTITYPLATFORM-v0.1.0`). It declares the system's participation in the AI Cognitive Fabric and binds it to the DAEF-01 encoding formula and SYSX-AI orchestration layer.

## Constitutional Invariants

The following invariants are constitutionally sealed and may not be overridden at any layer below the Governance Universe:

- This system is **AI-augmentable**, not AI-driven. Human-in-the-loop governance applies to all AI-assisted decisions.
- All AI invocations within this system MUST route through the `SYSX-AI` orchestration layer.
- No AI-driven state mutation is permitted without explicit human authorisation.
- All AI model outputs are advisory unless explicitly elevated by a ratified governance instrument.

## Cognitive Fabric Binding

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **System Code** | `SYS-IDA-IDENTITYPLATFORM-v0.1.0` |
| **Fabric Participation** | Active |
| **DAEF-01 Encoding** | Bound |
| **SYSX-AI Routing** | Mandatory |
| **AI Mutation Guard** | Enabled |
| **Governance Layer** | System |

## Ratification

This anchor was activated under the IPED-01 Full Activation Protocol on 2026-02-25 and is constitutionally sealed under the AGENT_EXECUTION_CONTEXT_MASTER_CONSTITUTION_v1.0.0.
